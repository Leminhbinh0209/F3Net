# Thinking in frequency: Face forgery detection by mining frequency-aware clues
*European Conference on Computer Vision 2020* <br /> 
<br />
This implementation is mainly based on the desciption in the [paper](https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2020/papers_ECCV/papers/123570086.pdf) on top of XceptionNet. The model have three version:
* **FAD**: Frequency-aware Decomposition
* **LFS**: Local Frequency Statistics
* **MixBlock**: Two-stream Collaborative Framework (@ block 7 and block 12)

Source code is mainly referenced from this [repo](https://github.com/yyk-wew/F3Net). <br />
